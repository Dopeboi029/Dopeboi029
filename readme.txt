### What do people have to say about Crisp Live Chat ?

*“Crisp stood out. It has roughly the same feature set as Intercom with a few additional features and it has simple/affordable pricing. The support from the team over there is great and new features pop up often.”* – Shai Almog, Co-founder of Codename

*“We could have had the same experience with other live chats as well, but the price tag combined with the feature set Crisp does offer, we would and already do recommend it to all customers who are looking for a live chat themselves. We’ve upgraded to the Crisp unlimited plan a while ago, and are glad that we made that decision.”* – Dominik Angerer, Founder of Storyblok
